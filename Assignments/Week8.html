      <p>This weeks assignment requires a combination in skills of soldering, use of the laser cutter, and 3D printing and design. In order to create a lightup acrylic sign, I need to design and print the acrylic sign, solder the electronic circuit for the LED's, and 3D Print the housing for it all.</p>
      <p>To design the Acrylic picture, I first utilized the template ai file provided.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week8.html"></a><img src="/images/AcrylicScreenshot0.jpeg" width= "500" height= "300">
      <p>I then extend the template to suit the shape that I desire, which will be more of a square.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week8.html"></a><img src="/images/AcrylicScreenshot1.jpeg" width= "500" height= "300">
      <p>Then I import my desired image. In this case, I chose a penguin from the game Club Penguin, as I have been recently reminded of it, and it is popular enough to catch peoples' eye when on display. Also, it's Club Penguin, who wouldn't like it.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week8.html"></a><img src="/images/AcrylicScreenshot2.5.jpeg" width= "500" height= "300">
      <p> I then traced the image, which placed the once pdf into a vector format that can be read by the machine.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week8.html"></a><img src="/images/AcrylicScreenshot2.jpeg" width= "500" height= "300">
      <p>After some rotation and resizing, the design is ready to go to the Laser Cutter.</p>

      <br>
      <p>This use of the Laser Cutter is very different than previous accounts, as I am not cutting wood, but rather 1/8" Acrylic. Thankfully, I was taught to manually adjust the speed and power settings of the laser within the machine to cut the material correctly, which allowed for the correct depths of cuts and speed of cutting. When making these adjustments, I needed to keep in mind the purpose and depth of each cut, which affected what speed and power I wanted to cut at. While I was given all the necessary numbers, I found the guide below helpful in determining why I made these decisions.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week8.html"></a><img src="/images/AcrylicScreenshot4.png" width= "500" height= "400">
      <p>After the manual mapping of laser power and speed, the process proceeds as normal, giving a final result of an engraved acrylic penguin!</p>

      <br>
      <p>When designing the 3D Printed Case, I need to account for several variables: The size of the boards, the weight of the sign, and the necessity for an opening for the power cable.</p>
      <br>
      <p>First, I mapped out a base size for the housing as a whole. Since the wooden componenets of this project measure 6x2.7, I made the design 6.3x3 to allow for the components to fit within the box, with thin walls surrounding.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week8.html"></a><img src="/images/IntegrateFusionScreenshot1.png" width= "500" height= "400">
      <p>I then added slight fillets to the edges of the design, allowing for the design to be a little less boxy, adding flair to the box and making it part of the design.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week8.html"></a><img src="/images/IntegrateFusionScreenshot2.png" width= "500" height= "400">
      <p>After extruding to a height of 1.5 inches, I placed a smaller box within and extruded it from the top of the design to .1 inches from the bottom, making up the space that will be where the electronic components reside.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week8.html"></a><img src="/images/IntegrateFusionScreenshot3.png" width= "500" height= "400">
      <p>Next, A slot must be placed to allow for the power cable for the electronic components. I placed it by the base of the box, so that it can reach the plug within the circuit board.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week8.html"></a><img src="/images/IntegrateFusionScreenshot4.png" width= "500" height= "400">
      <p>After extruding the hole for the power cable, the box for the components is complete.</p>

      <p>To have the lights shine on my acrylic design, I need to solder a pcb in the Digital Lab. After recieving training from Tuna, I used the template files to use the machine in the the Digital Lab, which cut into slabs of copper to drill out complex circuits. After using this machine, it was time to solder components onto the board. A small outlet for power input, as well as a capacitor, two transistors, and an integrated circuit.</p>

      <p>After soldering the components to the board, it is attached to the wooden housing, and then is ready to light up!</p>
