      <p>I used to help my friend keep bees for their honey buisiness, and for a while was interested in starting the hobby myself. My design will be for that company that I once wanted to start.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I sketched out designs and titles for my business logo.
      </p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroideryBag.png">
      <p> Within Adobe Illustrator, I started my unique design. First I gave a frame for it. Keeping with the bee theme, I chose a hexagon.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroidery8.png" width="500" height="450">
      <p>After making my structure, I began making the personal design: a bee! Utilizing the __ tool, I created shapes to mimic the body of a bee.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroidery6.png" width="500" height="450">
      <p>To improved the design, I added antennas and a stinger with the line tool, to give it a more lifelike feel, while also keeping a design level of simplicity.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroidery5.png" width="500" height="450">
      <p>To complete the logo design, I added stripes to mimic the body of a honey bee, differentiating the logo from other insects, while still keeping simplicity that is easy on the eyes.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroidery4.png" width="500" height="450">
      <p>To complete my design within Adobe Illustrator, I added my title for the company: Sweet Stinger Honey.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroidery7.png" width="500" height="450">
      <p>In order to improve our text, I sought out a font that suits my theme, landing on "Acumin Variable Concept". Which looks professional and unique, while also pragmatic in avoiding complications with the digital embroiderer.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroidery2.png" width="500" height="450">
      <p>After deciding on my font, I then implemented it into the design, and also chose to add color to the bee as well, to add some personality to the logo.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroidery3.png" width="500" height="450">
      <p>Then, to complete the design, I fixed text sizes and angling to crate a simple, professional, yet cute design for my honey company.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroidery1.png" width="500" height="450">
      <p>The purpose of this design is to look professional and simple, yet it must still be complex enough to convey the purpose of the company. The hexagon framing is simple, yet can be easily related to bees and honey, due to the honeycomb structure of hives. The bee design is composed of the most basic elements that can identify a bee, though through use of color and other minute designs, such as stripes and antenae, it is complex enough to be interesting and identifiable. This design serves its purpose of being identifiable as a honey company, while the complete use of space within the design, and simple structure of the design, promote a professional and effectife logo.</p>
      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroidery1.png" width="500" height="450">
      <br>
      <p>The Design is now ready to be attached to cloth. First, I imported the file into the Digital Embroidery Machine. From there, I can use the sewing and Digital Embroidery mechanics to first sew the bag the design will go on, and then finally attach the design.</p>

      <a href="/Assignments/Week4.html"></a><img src="/images/DigiEmbroideryCompleteDesign.png">
      <p>The embroidery is complete! Time to wow the fashion world and publicize my made up company.</p>
