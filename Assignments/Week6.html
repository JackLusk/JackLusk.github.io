      <p>FDM Printers work by heating and then extruding a filament in a semi-liquid state, that when solidifies creates a solid structure. By manipulating where and when filament is extruded, complex, three-dimensional structures can be created that remain sturdy and usable for quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>The Prusa Slicer is a type of FDM printer that we use at Wheaton. By reading a file imported to the machine, it can use installed PLA filament to lay out and create a small structure on its bed. The structures it can make are highly complex, creating sharp angles and structural supports, however the size of the structure is fairly small, roughly 10x12 inches. This means the machine is versatile in creating many objects, but only up to a certain size. </p>

      <p>To begin our design in Fusion 360, I create a basic circle, and then utilize the Offset tool to create a second layer to loft. After this I loft them, attaching each layer to eachother.</p>

   <p>Then, I Shell the shape to hollow it, as well as add some Fillet for added pizazz.</p>

  <p>It is ready to be uploaded! First I send it through PrusaSlicer Application, converting the file to GCode, and then upload it to the FDM Printer.</p>
