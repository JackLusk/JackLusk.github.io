      <p>For the final project, I have decided to create a box for my favorite game, Root! The box needs to be able to fit all of the game components, an as such will be multilayered, with interconnected shelves holding up the pieces.
        Shown below are early prototypes of the general look of my design.

    <p> After constructing my prototype, I needed to decide on final materials, which mostly consist of plywood and PLA. I made final decisions of exactly how much of what materials I require, and placed it in the following Excel Budget list.</p>

    <p>When constructing my box, I needed to make sure that the appropriate amount of iterations were in my project, and broke it down to these steps: Size and cut the necessary wood, Use the Shaper to create slots for shelves and door, Laser cut the door, Design and create 3D Printed containers, and finally piece the box together.</p>
    <br>
    <p> The first Iteration required much planning on the dimensions of the box, and I eventually settled that the bed should be just large enough to fit the biggest piece, and that the rest can fill in on subsequent shelves. I went to the woodshop and made the cuts to the woodm finishing the first iteration.</p>

    <p> The Shaper was a pain in my ass. It had difficulty recognizing when to make what cut when there were overlapping layers, it constantly lost track of Shaper tape, and it made one or two cuts that deviated from the lines. I even had to recut a bed to place my wood in to even start making cuts for my project. In the end however, I successfully used the shaper to make the slots for the door of my box and for the shelves to slide into. One of the following images is me in the shaper process, the other is a portion of the complete box, highlighting the cuts made by the Shaper.</p>

    <p> The next iteration requiered some careful use of CuteCutter, a program for vectorizing images, as well as some toying with the laser cutter. I chose to put the logo of the game on the front of the box door, and to do so had to redraw by hand some of the lettering to cause some depth to the logo, to reduce it looking uniformly shallow. I successfully made the cut with the laser cutter for the door, and I personally believe that the results were the greatest part of the project.</p>

    <p>The 3D printing was the most time consuming, but also the most rewarding. I constructed 3D printed holders to contain the pieces of the game, and while my early designs had some extra room, just in case some measurements were off, I refined the designs so that all of the components fit snuggly, resulting in containers perfect for holding the meeples and tokens of Root. Below is an example of one of the containers in the design process: In Fusion360, printed, and then filled.</p>

    <p>After all of the components were collected, it is time to construct the project. Using the woodshop, The box came together with the power of love (though primarily by using power tools).</p>

    <p>Reflection: While it was a large effort, I enjoyed putting this box together, and I will definitely put it to use. While it is just a tool to make my life a little easier, its nice to know that my work will lead to good use, and the box will look nice sitting on my shelf, not to mention I get to show off my construct every time I go to get a board game to play. The has been alot of fun, and I am looking forward to creating more projects in the future!</p>
