      <p>The Shaper works by mapping out a digital environment in which it moves, which relates to its real environment. This is important because the primary use of the shaper is to make cuts in wood in intricate designs, so its ability to know its location in real life means that it can make cuts accurate to the design. Not only can it make these cuts, it can notice when the user is deviating from the design, and may abort the task to make sure that the design remains intact. The machine itself consists of 3 components: The Shaper, which has the drill and camera for mapping the virtual environment, The Workspace, a wooden table used for maintaining a balanced platform for the Shaper, and the Vacuum, which sucks the wood dust away from the user and Shaper, preventing clogging and fire hazards.

      <p>When learning to use the shaper, follow the rules listed by the machine. If you follow the steps exactly, the Shaper is safe and easy to use!</p>

      <p> When making my design for the Shaper, I utilize Fusion 360. By creating a sketch, I can create the basic shape of the design, and after offsetting several other small shapes, can create the necessary indentations to map out my desk organizer. After that, it is a matter of applying the correct shading to the file, as the shaper can detect different designs and colors, which instruct it to cut wood in different ways. </p>
