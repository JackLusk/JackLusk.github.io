      <p> Vinyl Cutting is a form of digital fabrication, as it utilized programs to create the design that the cutter will slice,
        and then proceeds to relay that design to the cutter. Without a digital aspect of Vinyl Cutting, designs would have to be made freehand or with
        mechanical means, adding much more intense and unnecesarry labor to the project.

      <p> Raster graphics are made by adjusting the brightness coloration of pixels to create an image, while vector graphics use mathmatically derived shapes to create images. When used in a low pixel count, raster graphics can have poor definition, while vector graphics retain their definition.

      <p>The image that follows is my design within SirCutsAlot. I ultilized different fonts to draw attention to different words, and used a tool to curve the text around a shape, resulting in a more natural design.</p>
