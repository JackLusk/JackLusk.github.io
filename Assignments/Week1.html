      <p>For this assignment I worked with Tuna to establish a website that works as a collective source of my assignments.
          I will utilize this website to post my future assignments so that they can be appreciated and graded by others.
      </p>
      <p>In order to make this website, I copied an online template from Wix. I altered the template slightly, keeping the very basic information from the template (title boxes, buttons, links to pages within websites). I then customized each of these assets until I had a basic structure for my website.</p>
      <p> Below is the Main Page of my website, attached my About Me page.</p>

      <p>Within this project, I interacted with the field of cloning in software. Cloning is  the copying of software over to other hardware, in order to mimic the original processes of the donor hardware. In this case, I cloned the processes of each individual weekly project to another, so that I could efficiently and easily complete the weekly assignments by utilizing and basic, reusable template.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When the website is ready to be published, it must be pushed to github, which converts my code to a website that can be accesed via the internet. This is done through something called Git, where the program acts as a repository for all code inserted to the github, then through access to all of the files and available code, places the work into a format suitable to be viewed. In order for this viewed code to be properly formatted to be on a website, it must have been coded in HTML and CSS, two important parts of coding to websites. HTML is the programming language of the internet, and most, if not all, websites utilize it. CSS is a programming language that handles the graphics and visuals of websites, while HTML provides the structure and most of the content within the website. Through a combination of these technologies, a visually appealing and functional website can be constructed.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As previously stated, when the code is ready for the internet, it is pushed to GitHub. By pushing, it sends all of the data to GitHubs repository, and considers the new data to be the information for the website. If I desired to recieve the information from Github into my coding medium, in this case VisualStudio, I would utilize the pull action, which brings it to the medium to be worked on.</p>
<p>Below are some images of some of the processes of this week: The code for my home page, prjects page, and week 1 page, the actual website pages, and Github, the repository responsible for sending the info to the internet. </p>
